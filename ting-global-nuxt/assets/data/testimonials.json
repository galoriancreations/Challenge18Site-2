The uniqueness of the challenge in my opinion in its originality and creativity. Many deal with challenging issues but it seems that the most important thing is to do it in an interesting way and Sharon was very successful in this. There is something serious about the daily commitment to do a task whose scope depends on your desire and seriousness is important. Hopefully, more people in general and educators will experience the challenge."
